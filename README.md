# valorant-spike-timer_overwolf
A lightweight in-game overlay for Valorant that automatically starts a 45-second countdown whenever the spike is planted. Built using React and Overwolf, this app listens to real-time game events and displays a non-intrusive, always-on-top timer to help players optimize post-plant strategy and clutch potential.
